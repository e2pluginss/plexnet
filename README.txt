This is an implementation of the Plexnet demonstrating its benefits in the here
and now. See the ``documentation`` directory for more info.

You can checkout this repository by using::

  git clone git://github.com/tav/plexnet.git

And then, assuming you have the usual dev environment (gcc, make, etc.), run
``./plexnet/environ/startup/redpill init`` in a shell/terminal to get started...

All of the work, except for the bits in the ``third_party`` directory, have been
placed into the Public Domain. See ``documentation/license.txt`` for the full
Public Domain Declaration.
