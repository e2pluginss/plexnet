How does perfect specialization match nodes
============================================

Categories of spec nodes:

NotSpecNode - nothing special

FixedClassSpecNode - specnode with no know fields, matches the same class
  specnode, less general than NotSpecNode.

VirtualSpecNode - a virtual. matches only specnode that uses exactly
  the same fields in the identical manner.

VirtualListSpecNode - same as virtual

VirtualizableSpecNode - virtualizable. This one is a little bit more complex:
  for matching, VirtualizableSpecNode matches NotSpecNode (it was not used
  at all, hence no guard_nonvirtualized) or VirtualizableSpecNode with a
  common subset of fields.

Say v0 (Virtualizable) has fields a, b and v1 to match has fields b, c
means that b need to have the exact same shape, but a and c can stay
whatever they are.
