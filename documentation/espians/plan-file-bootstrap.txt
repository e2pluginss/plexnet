:Abstract:

    This is the plan file for the Bootstrap phase of [[Iteration X]] -- it will
    be updated regularly as progress is made.

Embedded Interpreter
====================

We will be using PyPy to build our own interpreter called Naaga.

.. tag:: id:1, done, @fijal

  We need to extend PyPy so that it can create a library version of interpreters.
  To start with it should produce ``libnaaga`` on both Linux and OS X.

.. tag:: wip, @fijal

  We need to extend PyPy so that it can create a library version of interpreters.
  To start with it should produce ``libnaaga`` on both Linux and OS X.

.. tag:: needsreview, @fijal

  We need to extend PyPy so that it can create a library version of interpreters.
  To start with it should produce ``libnaaga`` on both Linux and OS X.

.. tag:: id:2, wip, @oierw, Milestone:FirstRelease

  The Naaga interpreter needs to compile cleanly on OS X 10.4 (Tiger) and 10.5
  (Leopard).

.. tag:: todo, @fijal, @JohnMW, @happyseaurchin, @jeffarch, @sbp, @thruflo,
         @cre8radix, @evangineer, #design, #testing, #ui, #outreach, #backend

Optimisations
=============

.. tag:: id:3, inreview, @tav, dep:2, #foo, milestone:FirstRelease

  The ``validation.validate`` decorator should create a decorated version of the
  service function by generating the appropriate bytecode for the new function
  instead of creating it by exec-ing generated source code.

.. tag:: id:4, todo, @tav, dep:2, #foo, milestone:FirstRelease

  The ``validation.validate`` decorator should create a decorated version of the
  service function by generating the appropriate bytecode for the new function
  instead of creating it by exec-ing generated source code.
