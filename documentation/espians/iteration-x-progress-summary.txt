:Subject: Week 8 Progress Update on Iteration X
:Body:

 Â·

 Hey lovers,

 Today marks the end of the first 8 weeks of Iteration X. And I figured
 I'd provide a summary of all the cool shit that everyone's been up to.

 First, the latest design for Espra Trust Maps interface just landed.
 Check it out:

 * http://cloud.github.com/downloads/tav/plexnet/gfx.espra-trust-map.home-3b.jpg

 The beautiful work is by James Arthur (thruflo) and Matt Morse -- be
 sure to reply with your thoughts on the design!

 James has been continuing the hard work of implementing Trust Maps on
 App Engine and it's been progressing nicely. ETA for launch is
 mid-August on trustmap.org and the code base is at:

 * https://github.com/tav/bootstrap/tree/master/espra (limited access)

 After many years without a web site, we finally have a website!! It's
 dynamically generated from text files in the Plexnet Git repository
 and can be seen at:

 * http://www.espians.com

 For those of you new to Git, there's even an extensive intro:

 * http://www.espians.com/getting-started-with-git.html

 Jeff Archambeault (jeffarch) valiantly tried to keep a manual shaila
 summary of the proceedings at:

 * http://tiny.cc/shaila

 Maciej Fijalkowski (fijal) got PyPy (the base for our naaga "plexnet
 programming language") compiling as an embeddable library with a
 minimal C API. And together with Mathew Ryden (oierw), he's been
 working miracles on getting our interpreter integrated into WebKit --
 so we don't have to work around Javascript's limitations:

 * http://github.com/tav/plexnet/tree/master/source/client/webkit_bridge
 * http://github.com/tav/webkit_titanium

 Mathew also worked with Sean B. Palmer (sbp) to create a wicked
 implementation of some of the Plexnet object model:

 * http://github.com/tav/plexnet/blob/master/source/plexnet/core/data.py

 This was based on information that Sean had successfully managed to
 extract from me using IRC interviews and documented at:

 * http://inamidst.com/stuff/esp/plexdata

 Mamading Ceesay (evangineer) dived into the world of iPhone and
 Objective-C and started laying down the foundations of the
 sure-to-be-sexy Espra iPhone client:

 * https://github.com/tav/bootstrap/tree/master/iphone

 He and I also dabbled a bit with Google Caja and running a cajoler on
 App Engine Java but ended up concluding that it wasn't worth investing
 in for now.

 Mamading, along with Sofia Bustamante (olasofia) and David Pinto
 (happyseaurchin), have also been providing a lot of invaluable
 help/guidance on a day to day basis.

 And, in preparation for the eventual launch, John McCane-Whitney
 (JohnMW) has started compiling a contact/info list of hundreds of
 thought leaders and organisations that we should be contacting for the
 marketing "Blitz".

 Alex Tomkins (GReaper) continues to make sure our servers are running
 fine and along with Danny Bruder (cre8radix) and Jeff -- with their
 IRC bots/logging -- continues to provide a reliable infrastructure
 that we can all operate on.

 And, oh, I also created a super sexy framework called Weblite for App Engine:

 * https://github.com/tav/bootstrap/tree/insanity/appengine/ (limited access)

 And, finally, following Participation Camp in NYC by Matt Cooperrider
 (mattcoop) and virtually hosted by the Radical Inclusion guys --
 Suresh Fernando (sureshf) and Stephan Dohrn (stephandohrn) -- we
 formed a new initiative "OpenKollab" with some other cool dudes like
 Michael Maranda (tropology) and Gerry:

 * http://openkollab.com

 And together we've come with an exciting roadmap which starts with
 using Wagn (a Ruby on Rails-based structured wiki with transclusions)
 and incorporates the Plexnet/Espra vision:

 * http://wiki.openkollab.com/Roadmap

 All in all, it's been a wonderful 8 weeks and lots of thanks to the
 brilliant work that everyone's been doing!!

 Feel free to chime in with your thoughts!

 love and kisses, tav
