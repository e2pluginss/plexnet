Make your own organization
==========================

or: tools for building your own organization infrastructure

or: what esp is going to offer to customers - in return for money.

This is what we are going to sell:

Basic node usage
----------------

The customer just wants to use the plex, and some standard services
provided. So he pays n EUR a month to get an entity on some of the
hight quality nodes, where he then can act as a normal plexian.

A bit like your normal web hosting.

myoo agent
----------

If the customer wants to really heavily use the plex and do more with
it, he can become a myoo agent. This gives access to high quality
services and some form of interface to easily put together new
services from the old ones. And you can resell basic node usage.

A bit like a dedicated web server with a cool admin interface and the
right to resell.


ESP developer network
---------------------

A customer wants to have services developed by the uebercool
developers that are members of the esp developers network. So if he
subscribes to it he will have access to the developers, and might get
a good rate for the development costs.


Auditing
--------

The customer can get his own code audited, to be used in the S.A.F.E
environment (see Services in the plex description)

Cerification
------------

The customer wants to get certified as a developer. An FooBar
certified developer.
