2 Weeks Introduction

In either late 2004 or early 2005, Tav was interrogated -- about the Plexnet
architecture -- in Berlin by t (Yan Minagawa) and jhb (Joerg Baach). He was
given the option of being rewarded with Nutella if he answered well or facing
pain at the end of a knife if he didn't. At one moment, he was even knife-fed
some Nutella...

Jokes aside, these documents contain a snapshot of the technical architecture of
the Plexnet at that time. Tav is extremely thankful to both interrogators and
especially to Joerg Baach who wrote up the results of the interrogation.

Various details have changed, but the general architecture is still very much
the same -- and thus these documents should prove more useful than as just
historic references.
