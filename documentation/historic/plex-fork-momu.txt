Memorandum of Mutual Understanding (MoMU):
 - Plexnow.com will show the agreed page[1] until Sept. 11 2002, when it will 
   be transferred to the espians. 
 - We intend to fairly mention and link to the other project according to our 
   judgement. 
 - Project code as of this date is owned by the respective authors and licensed
   under the LGPL. 
 - Developers of either project (including all espians) are free to work on the
   other project.
 - In general, both projects and their developers intend to work peacefully 
   together and treat each other with respect.
 - This decision is final.
