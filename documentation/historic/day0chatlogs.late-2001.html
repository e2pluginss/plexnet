[4:07] &lt;philh> lo<br />
[4:07] &lt;AaronSw> Hello<br />
[4:08] &lt;tav`> hi<br />
[4:08] &lt;tav`> recall the mesh thing i was on about?<br />
[4:08] &lt;philh> aye<br />
[4:08] &lt;tav`> well, we've reverted to the older name of plex for it<br />
[4:09] &lt;tav`> and have started along the merry road of its procreation<br />
[4:09] &lt;philh> ok, marvellous, I'm yup for it, as much as I can do anyway.<br />
[4:10] &lt;AaronSw> Well that's one.<br />
[4:10] &lt;AaronSw> Hi philh, nice to meet you. I'm <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/">http://www.aaronsw.com/</a><br />
[4:10] &lt;philh> I could prob get some time in work for it as well, have to speak to my boss, but he's v. interested in this stuff so shouldn't e too much trouble<br />
[4:10] &lt;philh> hi AaronSw, philh, url withheld to protect the innocent<br />
[4:11] &lt;philh> :)<br />
[4:11] &lt;AaronSw> heheh<br />
[4:11] &lt;AaronSw> Hmm, rss_XSLT...<br />
[4:12] &lt;philh> sounds like something I'd do<br />
[4:12] *** nym (nym@espnow.com) has joined the channel<br />
[4:12] &lt;nym> hey<br />
[4:12] &lt;AaronSw> Hi there.<br />
[4:12] &lt;philh> lo nym, wassup<br />
[4:12] * AaronSw was one of the RSS 1.0 authors<br />
[4:12] &lt;nym> first off, i'd like to say that mewtwo rocks, as well as espnow<br />
[4:13] &lt;AaronSw> This feels "the band gets back together".<br />
[4:13] * philh is impressed<br />
[4:13] * nym plays his triangle.<br />
[4:13] &lt;philh> well sorta<br />
[4:13] &lt;AaronSw> impressed with what?<br />
[4:13] &lt;AaronSw> tav's ability to make people magically appear<br />
[4:14] &lt;nym> i'm not sure why tav invited me, but i'm honored<br />
[4:14] *** zooko (~zooko@140.184.83.37) has joined the channel<br />
[4:14] &lt;zooko> Greetings, world!<br />
[4:14] &lt;AaronSw> w00t! Zooko!<br />
[4:14] &lt;zooko> I gotta run in 15 mins or less.<br />
[4:14] &lt;philh> tav is sorta persuasive, ;)<br />
[4:14] &lt;tav`> greets!<br />
[4:14] * AaronSw wonders how much tav is paying all of you<br />
[4:14] &lt;tav`> zooko: the revolution is at hand, and we would like you to join us ;p<br />
[4:14] &lt;tav`> AaronSw will fill in the missing bits ;p<br />
[4:14] * deltab saves "&lt;AaronSw> Hi philh, nice to meet you. I'm <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/">http://www.aaronsw.com/</a>" away to paste into #rdfig sometime<br />
[4:15] &lt;AaronSw> Why?<br />
[4:15] &lt;AaronSw> I always say that.<br />
[4:15] &lt;deltab> you're a website!<br />
[4:15] &lt;AaronSw> Fine, I'm [ foaf:homepage &lt;<a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/">http://www.aaronsw.com/</a>> ]<br />
[4:15] &lt;AaronSw> Happy?<br />
[4:15] &lt;zooko> Hey Tav!<br />
[4:15] &lt;AaronSw> Zooko, tell us about this distributed names project you're working on<br />
[4:15] &lt;zooko> I'm a crummy shot with a rifle.<br />
[4:15] &lt;deltab> :-)<br />
[4:15] &lt;zooko> I haven't really started.<br />
[4:15] &lt;AaronSw> That's OK, neither have we.<br />
[4:16] &lt;AaronSw> So you're right on schedule.<br />
[4:16] &lt;zooko> Err, well, the first thing I'm doing on that project is reading Fiat's paper about attack resistant Chord-like networks.<br />
[4:16] &lt;nym> aaron- Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh?<br />
[4:16] &lt;zooko> Ack!  Two different IRC servers!  I'm getting dizzy.<br />
[4:16] &lt;nym> or Rich Site Summary?<br />
[4:16] &lt;AaronSw> RDF Site Summary.<br />
[4:16] &lt;AaronSw> aka Rich Site Summary<br />
[4:17] &lt;nym> aha.. just looked at everything2<br />
[4:17] * philh goes into listen mode<br />
[4:17] &lt;AaronSw> So the goal of the plex project...<br />
[4:17] &lt;AaronSw> is to create a sort of vast network<br />
[4:18] *** look (~look@msp-26-185-92.mn.rr.com) has joined the channel<br />
[4:18] &lt;AaronSw> thru which data transports very quickly.<br />
[4:18] &lt;AaronSw> Hi look<br />
[4:18] &lt;look> hey, aaron. You're everywhere ;-)<br />
[4:18] &lt;AaronSw> Hmm... I need a better elevator pitch.<br />
[4:18] &lt;look> AaronSw: JokeXML made me groan<br />
[4:18] &lt;AaronSw> I didn't write it!<br />
[4:18] &lt;AaronSw> Not my fault.<br />
[4:19] &lt;look> heh<br />
[4:19] &lt;look> It still made me groan<br />
[4:19] &lt;AaronSw> Ok.. prewritten elevator speech:<br />
[4:19] &lt;AaronSw> Imagine a vast network of machines across the Internet. They run special software which hooks them together into a large "pool" of data, thru which data flows freely. To transfer information from one machine to another, you simply drop it into the pool. Like a drop of dye, it disperses itself across the machines, making it safely stored and fast to access.<br />
[4:19] &lt;nym> freenet?<br />
[4:19] &lt;look> heh<br />
[4:19] *** xena (tav@espnow.com) has joined the channel<br />
[4:19] &lt;AaronSw> Freenet is too slow.<br />
[4:19] &lt;look> And confusing<br />
[4:19] &lt;AaronSw> Yeah.<br />
[4:19] &lt;nym> well, it's getting better, but are you talking about a encryptionless fred?<br />
[4:19] &lt;philh> too true<br />
[4:20] &lt;look> How is this different? And why is it better than Chord?<br />
[4:20] &lt;AaronSw> fred?<br />
[4:20] &lt;nym> That's what I'd like to know. Fred is Freenet's nickname<br />
[4:20] &lt;zooko> Awesome.  Sounds like fun!<br />
[4:20] &lt;tav`> fred == freenet node<br />
[4:20] &lt;zooko> I'm off to family time now but I'll lurk here and read logs later.<br />
[4:20] *** zooko is now known as zooko_family_ti<br />
[4:20] &lt;AaronSw> Thanks Zooko.<br />
[4:20] &lt;look> later zooko<br />
[4:20] &lt;AaronSw> c'ya<br />
[4:21] * tav` waves to zooko<br />
[4:21] &lt;look> is this called "plex" or does this channel have another purpose?<br />
[4:21] &lt;tav`> it's called plex<br />
[4:21] &lt;look> Esp project?<br />
[4:21] &lt;tav`> yes<br />
[4:21] &lt;AaronSw> Wel...<br />
[4:21] &lt;tav`> but as of 3 hours from now, esp becomes open!<br />
[4:21] &lt;AaronSw> Woohoo!!<br />
[4:21] &lt;look> reaallly.<br />
[4:21] &lt;look> interesting<br />
[4:21] &lt;nym> open? <br />
[4:22] &lt;look> xnet or whatever is operating?<br />
[4:22] &lt;nym> as in source, or open for business?<br />
[4:22] &lt;AaronSw> look, another difference between this and chord is that it stores RDF-style triples instead of just key/value<br />
[4:22] &lt;tav`> xnet is scheduled for 2nd of november<br />
[4:22] &lt;look> AaronSw: what was the first difference? <br />
[4:23] &lt;AaronSw> Hmm... Chord is just a way of storing content, no?<br />
[4:23] &lt;AaronSw> The plex is a place to ask "questions"<br />
[4:23] &lt;look> are you guys working on a distributed authentication service? Cuz I really want one of those. I have no idea how to design one though.<br />
[4:23] &lt;look> We need one to stop Passport.<br />
[4:23] &lt;AaronSw> Agreed.<br />
[4:23] &lt;tav`> look: the idea with the plex is that you could build services on applications of all sorts on top of it<br />
[4:24] &lt;AaronSw> It's like the Internet really, but breaking away from Client Server.<br />
[4:24] &lt;nym> okay, but is it p2p, or centralized?<br />
[4:24] &lt;tav`> we are ehm basically remaking the internet in its true image ;p<br />
[4:24] &lt;look> Couldn't it be built as a layer on top of Chord? Not that you *want* to, but RDF triples are just data when you get down to it<br />
[4:24] &lt;look> heh, I'm for that<br />
[4:24] &lt;tav`> nym: decentralised<br />
[4:25] &lt;look> No encryption?<br />
[4:25] &lt;AaronSw> Optional encryption.<br />
[4:25] &lt;look> cool<br />
[4:25] &lt;look> have you started building it?<br />
[4:25] &lt;tav`> nope. we were debating whether we should open up to the masses before we have a solid base established or vice versa...<br />
[4:25] &lt;nym> where can i learn about Chord?<br />
[4:26] &lt;AaronSw> Google recommends <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.033/www/handouts/dp2-chord.html">http://web.mit.edu/6.033/www/handouts/dp2-chord.html</a><br />
[4:26] &lt;look> I'd build it first -- then you won't have a ton of hangers-on like Freenet does<br />
[4:27] &lt;tav`> .google chord decentralised<br />
[4:27] &lt;xena> chord decentralised: <a href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/clarke99distributed.html">http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/clarke99distributed.html</a><br />
[4:27] &lt;look> I think I know why you want this. You need some way to do discovery for the Semantic Web (aka, RDF data). Am I right?<br />
[4:27] &lt;AaronSw> Well, that's part of it.<br />
[4:28] &lt;look> I joined #rdfig so I could ask how you guys are planning to do RDF discovery<br />
[4:28] &lt;AaronSw> Here's one answer. :)<br />
[4:28] &lt;AaronSw> Another is crawling.<br />
[4:28] &lt;AaronSw> But you can send the mesh with RDF queries.<br />
[4:28] &lt;look> Crawling was the solution I thought of...an RDF google<br />
[4:29] &lt;AaronSw> Like one query might be what messages have me in the To: header<br />
[4:29] &lt;AaronSw> voila! mesh-mail<br />
[4:29] &lt;AaronSw> your IM program might make a similar query<br />
[4:29] &lt;look> hmmm...not very private :)<br />
[4:29] &lt;AaronSw> Well, the message body would be encrypted of course.<br />
[4:29] &lt;tav`> one node sending out a query might be tracking #plex chat<br />
[4:30] &lt;AaronSw> If you want to get a webpage, you just query for data with that URI<br />
[4:30] &lt;AaronSw> of course the content comes back with a signature for auth<br />
[4:30] &lt;AaronSw> but then you have a decentralized web<br />
[4:30] &lt;AaronSw> anyone can publish similarly.<br />
[4:31] &lt;look> How fast do you see this being?<br />
[4:31] &lt;look> ...oh, and what user interface?<br />
[4:32] &lt;AaronSw> Faster than the Internet, because data will move closer to you instead of being at a single (or cluster) of servers.<br />
[4:32] &lt;AaronSw> What user interface does the Web have?<br />
[4:32] &lt;AaronSw> It's infrastructure to build those kinds of things on top of.<br />
[4:32] &lt;look> browser-based, of course<br />
[4:32] &lt;tav`> (web's a bad example there)<br />
[4:32] &lt;nym> so the goal is to maximize bandwidth?<br />
[4:32] &lt;philh> not neccesarily<br />
[4:32] &lt;AaronSw> s/Web/Internet/<br />
[4:33] &lt;AaronSw> Sorry<br />
[4:33] &lt;AaronSw> misspoke<br />
[4:33] &lt;tav`> ;p<br />
[4:33] &lt;AaronSw> The goal is to distribute resources.<br />
[4:33] &lt;AaronSw> Bandwidth is one<br />
[4:33] &lt;AaronSw> processing power is another<br />
[4:33] &lt;AaronSw> disk space is a third<br />
[4:34] &lt;tav`> modern day p2p apps are way too specialised<br />
[4:34] &lt;look> I imagine my way to access this is to set up a Plex proxy server on my machine<br />
[4:34] &lt;nym> So, well, who decides what would ulitize the resources<br />
[4:34] &lt;look> I like specialized apps. I want to build a sharing program that *only* shares *albums* with my *friends* -- and that's it.<br />
[4:34] &lt;look> And also does MP3 file renaming to my scheme :)<br />
[4:35] &lt;AaronSw> look, think of this as the new INternet.<br />
[4:35] &lt;tav`> look: you can do that on top of the mesh<br />
[4:35] &lt;AaronSw> nym, whoever offers them<br />
[4:35] &lt;look> yeah I know.<br />
[4:35] &lt;tav`> mental note: start using the plex<br />
[4:35] &lt;look> Hmmm...it's a framework.<br />
[4:35] &lt;tav`> my favourites are reputation servers<br />
[4:35] &lt;look> People have been talking about creating one for a long time, but nothing so far.<br />
[4:36] &lt;tav`> it's one of the first things that you'll be seeing for the plex ;p<br />
[4:36] &lt;look> Can you have reputation without authentication? I was pondering that today. I don't think so.<br />
[4:36] &lt;look> So it all comes down to authentication.<br />
[4:36] &lt;AaronSw> look, all you need is identification, I'd think.<br />
[4:36] &lt;nym> thinkcache helps, but that's not unique<br />
[4:36] &lt;tav`> just need to be able to identify yourself<br />
[4:36] &lt;AaronSw> "That's the one! He stole my doggie!"<br />
[4:36] &lt;tav`> snap<br />
[4:37] &lt;AaronSw> nym, thinkcache?<br />
[4:37] &lt;tav`> thinkcash<br />
[4:37] &lt;look> Websites that offer trust/reputation all have centralized identification services that only work on that site. (Ebay, Slashdot, Advogato)<br />
[4:37] &lt;tav`> .google thinkcash<br />
[4:37] &lt;xena> thinkcash: <a href="http://lists.freenetproject.org/pipermail/devl/2001-May/006123.html">http://lists.freenetproject.org/pipermail/devl/2001-May/006123.html</a><br />
[4:37] &lt;AaronSw> Ah.<br />
[4:37] &lt;look> someone clue me in on the split between "identification" and "authentication"<br />
[4:37] &lt;tav`> although i fail to see how thinkcash helps in this situation<br />
[4:37] &lt;AaronSw> identification: "He's the one." authentication: "Trust me, I'm really him!"<br />
[4:37] &lt;nym> well, it only proves that the person voting is a human<br />
[4:38] &lt;nym> that person can vote forever.<br />
[4:38] &lt;tav`> nym: ah, in terms of the reputation server?<br />
[4:38] &lt;look> I like thinkcash, it's a cool idea.<br />
[4:38] &lt;nym> yeah, yahoo mail uses it<br />
[4:38] &lt;tav`> yes, it makes good sense there<br />
[4:38] &lt;nym> tav- yeah<br />
[4:39] &lt;tav`> btw, on the point of zope, zeo allows processing power to be shared...<br />
[4:39] &lt;AaronSw> Is ThinkCash == TuringCash ?<br />
[4:39] &lt;look> hmm...define turing cash<br />
[4:40] &lt;AaronSw> <a href="http://lists.freenetproject.org/pipermail/devl/2001-May/006123.html">http://lists.freenetproject.org/pipermail/devl/2001-May/006123.html</a> <br />
[4:40] &lt;AaronSw> > TuringCash works like this.  Specify a little virtual machine with a very<br />
[4:40] &lt;AaronSw> > clean instruction set.  The email recipient publishes the algorithm to<br />
[4:40] &lt;AaronSw> > run and the expected running time.  The output of the algorithm must<br />
[4:40] &lt;AaronSw> > be submitted (just like the hash collision in the case of HashCash).<br />
[4:40] &lt;AaronSw> > The virtual machine sandbox would be provably secure (not hard with a<br />
[4:40] &lt;AaronSw> > clean instruction set).<br />
[4:40] &lt;look> ThinkCash is easy for a computer to generate and validate, but (hopefully) impossible or hard for a computer to pass the test.<br />
[4:40] &lt;AaronSw> I see.<br />
[4:40] &lt;look> Hah, TurningCash would work great...if you're a programmer.<br />
[4:40] &lt;AaronSw> What algorithm does Yahoo use?<br />
[4:41] &lt;look> ThinkCash is usually just some numbers in an image with some visual noise<br />
[4:41] &lt;look> "What's the Number?"<br />
[4:41] &lt;AaronSw> OK, thought so<br />
[4:41] &lt;AaronSw> AV uses that too now.<br />
[4:41] &lt;look> Computer vision algorithms are so primitive that it's very hard to figure out what's in the image<br />
[4:41] &lt;look> Yes, I thought AV used it.<br />
[4:41] &lt;tav`> turing and think are different....<br />
[4:42] &lt;AaronSw> So... any more questions?<br />
[4:43] &lt;look> How?<br />
[4:43] *** aminorex (~alk@199.199.248.19) has joined the channel<br />
[4:43] &lt;AaronSw> Hi aminorex<br />
[4:43] &lt;aminorex> hola<br />
[4:43] &lt;look> hey tony<br />
[4:43] &lt;aminorex> anybody know why i'm here?<br />
[4:43] &lt;AaronSw> Do you?<br />
[4:43] &lt;look> Any docs yet?<br />
[4:43] &lt;look> It's the cabal<br />
[4:43] &lt;deltab> tav invited you?<br />
[4:43] &lt;AaronSw> look, I'm working on an intro for laypeople.<br />
[4:44] &lt;aminorex> deltab: that was definitely a contributing factor:))<br />
[4:44] &lt;tav`> hi!<br />
[4:44] *** AaronSw has changed the topic to "Welcome to day 0 of the new Internet."<br />
[4:44] &lt;nym> please, aaronsw<br />
[4:44] &lt;AaronSw> heheheh<br />
[4:44] &lt;look> heh<br />
[4:45] &lt;aminorex> tomorrow is day 1?<br />
[4:45] &lt;AaronSw> .time<br />
[4:45] &lt;xena> 2001/10/24 21:45:07.89356 Universal<br />
[4:45] &lt;look> There're be no VB programmers in the New Internet<br />
[4:45] &lt;AaronSw> It depends how well today goes.<br />
[4:45] &lt;tav`> it becomes day 1 in 2 and a few hours<br />
[4:45] &lt;AaronSw> :-)<br />
[4:45] &lt;tav`> look: python seems to be the language of the day ;p<br />
[4:46] &lt;AaronSw> So what do you guys think we should do next?<br />
[4:46] &lt;tav`> look: care to give aminorex a quick summary?<br />
[4:46] &lt;look> aminorex: Think of it as Chord for RDF<br />
[4:46] &lt;AaronSw> Heheh.<br />
[4:47] &lt;AaronSw> Benefits: It unifies the ever increasing number of application protocols. It stops the "downed server" problem. It lets you keep your data in sync. It makes collaboration easier.<br />
[4:47] &lt;look> They want to make a P2P substrate for building real applications. At least, that's the impression I get.<br />
[4:47] * deltab figures out why it's called Chord<br />
[4:48] &lt;AaronSw> circle of fifths?<br />
[4:48] &lt;look> AaronSw, you should paste your pre-written speil<br />
[4:48] &lt;AaronSw> OK: Imagine a vast network of machines across the Internet. They run special software which hooks them together into a large "pool" of data, thru which data flows freely. To transfer information from one machine to another, you simply drop it into the pool. Like a drop of dye, it disperses itself across the machines, making it safely stored and fast to access.<br />
[4:48] &lt;AaronSw> The data is written in simple "sentences" which are widely compatible and easy to process. So to retrieve data is just has simple -- you simply set up a "filter", so to speak, in the pool. This works like a sentence with some blank spots in it -- sentences that fit the pattern come pass thru the filter and are picked up by your computer. Those that don't fit are ignored.<br />
[4:49] &lt;aminorex> Who holds the agenda?  Tav?<br />
[4:50] &lt;tav`> it's an open forum today<br />
[4:50] &lt;tav`> basic aim is to set this project in motion <br />
[4:50] &lt;tav`> and we'd like you guys to join us, as we think you are wonderful<br />
[4:50] &lt;AaronSw> I'm thinking: 1) Does it make sense? 2) What do we do now?<br />
[4:51] &lt;tav`> ;p<br />
[4:51] &lt;AaronSw> So feel free to answer those questions.<br />
[4:51] &lt;tav`> ah, the quiet before the storm ;p<br />
[4:52] &lt;AaronSw> Well, for the next person who answers the questions... tav, tell them what they can win!<br />
[4:52] &lt;AaronSw> ;-)<br />
[4:53] &lt;look> My issue is this: Freenet has a good idea. But the design is terrible. The designers have a bad case of NIH syndrome. <br />
[4:53] &lt;look> How is this better?<br />
[4:53] &lt;AaronSw> We don't have NIH.<br />
[4:53] &lt;AaronSw> :-)<br />
[4:53] &lt;look> That's a good start :b<br />
[4:53] &lt;tav`> and, we have learnt from freenet<br />
[4:53] &lt;aminorex> freenet has serious problems<br />
[4:53] &lt;AaronSw> We're not going to repeat Freenet's mistakes.<br />
[4:53] &lt;AaronSw> We're making anonymity optional.<br />
[4:53] &lt;AaronSw> Optimization is a priority.<br />
[4:53] &lt;aminorex> i've always felt that anonymity should be handled well<br />
[4:54] &lt;AaronSw> We're starting with metadata, not huge files.<br />
[4:54] &lt;aminorex> and orthogonally<br />
[4:54] &lt;look> I guess you espians are pretty much freenet experts, with Espra<br />
[4:54] &lt;look> Are files transfered outside the grid?<br />
[4:54] &lt;aminorex> through a mixnet<br />
[4:54] &lt;AaronSw> exactly, alk<br />
[4:55] &lt;aminorex> when you say dispersed, you mean the actual data is distributed over the nodes?<br />
[4:55] &lt;aminorex> if so, how?  FEC?<br />
[4:55] &lt;aminorex> WAN-RAID?<br />
[4:55] &lt;aminorex> or n-gram SOMs?<br />
[4:55] &lt;AaronSw> well, initially we're hoping that data will be small<br />
[4:55] &lt;tav`> aminorex: those are questions yet to be answered<br />
[4:56] &lt;AaronSw> specific choices like that haven't been made yet<br />
[4:56] &lt;aminorex> small means fec is impractical unless it is overlaid over a block filesystem<br />
[4:56] &lt;aminorex> that would make writes expensive<br />
[4:56] &lt;AaronSw> I'm hoping that actual data isn't going to be broken up and distributed for phase one.<br />
[4:56] &lt;AaronSw> I'm thinking smaller stuff like pointers into other systems.<br />
[4:57] &lt;AaronSw> And building scaffolding for categorization and search, reputation and trust.<br />
[4:57] &lt;AaronSw> the actual data can reside in freenet/mojonation/etc. for now.<br />
[4:57] &lt;aminorex> or web servers including gnutella nodes<br />
[4:57] &lt;tav`> aminorex: you might be interested to know that we intend to replace dns... ;p<br />
[4:57] &lt;aminorex> or SMB shares<br />
[4:58] &lt;aminorex> cool.  i'm keen on that too.<br />
[4:58] &lt;aminorex> it needs to be done from inside the system i think<br />
[4:58] &lt;aminorex> make a local DNS interface that is better, more useful than the default<br />
[4:58] &lt;AaronSw> w/o centralization<br />
[4:58] &lt;aminorex> embrace and extend<br />
[4:58] *** sbp (~sean@p45s13a06.client.global.net.uk) has joined the channel<br />
[4:58] &lt;aminorex> exactly<br />
[4:59] &lt;AaronSw> tav, hope you don't mind I invited sbp<br />
[4:59] &lt;AaronSw> So what do you all think our next steps should be?<br />
[4:59] &lt;AaronSw> I'm thinking we should start a mailing list.<br />
[4:59] &lt;tav`> AaronSw: not at all, feel free to invite anyone interesting<br />
[4:59] &lt;sbp> ah, that excludes me, then<br />
[4:59] &lt;aminorex> my bud usama...<br />
[5:00] &lt;tav`> hehe<br />
[5:00] &lt;AaronSw> heheh<br />
[5:00] *** aminorex is now known as ubl<br />
[5:00] &lt;tav`> welcome ubl!<br />
[5:00] &lt;ubl> allah akhbar!<br />
[5:00] &lt;AaronSw> heheh<br />
[5:00] &lt;philh> I agree with AaronSw we need a mailing list<br />
[5:00] &lt;look> Usama, I love what you've done with your beard<br />
[5:01] &lt;look> We need a Wiki! ;)<br />
[5:01] &lt;tav`> salam wa alikum<br />
[5:01] &lt;AaronSw> That's what I said, look!<br />
[5:01] &lt;AaronSw> But tav wants to finish his superwiki first.<br />
[5:01] &lt;tav`> we'll have the xnet ;p<br />
[5:01] &lt;look> sorry, I was talking to my roommate<br />
[5:01] &lt;AaronSw> And we probably will need CVS too.<br />
[5:01] &lt;AaronSw> tav grabbed the plexdev.org domain<br />
[5:02] &lt;ubl> sourceforge may be crumpling gradually, so goes the chicken-little rumor mill<br />
[5:02] &lt;look> yes, SF is fubar<br />
[5:02] &lt;tav`> ubl: we have fat servers<br />
[5:02] &lt;ubl> there's a gpl-centric fsf sourceforge<br />
[5:02] &lt;ubl> i forgot the name!<br />
[5:02] &lt;look> Savanna<br />
[5:02] &lt;deltab> savannah<br />
[5:02] &lt;AaronSw> I think ESP should be able to host it all for us<br />
[5:02] &lt;deltab> yup<br />
[5:02] &lt;look> I thought ESP had no money<br />
[5:02] &lt;AaronSw> but we do have deltab ;)<br />
[5:03] &lt;deltab> all our money goes on the server :-)<br />
[5:03] &lt;ubl> any plan for the licensing of infrastructure code?<br />
[5:03] &lt;look> yeah, what'll that be?<br />
[5:03] &lt;tav`> lgpl seems real fascinating<br />
[5:03] &lt;AaronSw> that's what I was thinking<br />
[5:03] * ubl puts on bsd horns<br />
[5:03] &lt;AaronSw> or perhaps BSD<br />
[5:03] &lt;look> LGPL is important<br />
[5:03] &lt;deltab> heh<br />
[5:03] &lt;tav`> i think lgpl needs a complete marketing revamp<br />
[5:03] &lt;AaronSw> LGPL, it's what's for dinner.<br />
[5:04] &lt;look> I would perhaps put stuff you REALLY, REALLY want adopted under the BSD<br />
[5:04] &lt;tav`> i mean i hated it for years, before i realised the true meaning of lgpl<br />
[5:04] &lt;ubl> stuff you want embraced and extended:P<br />
[5:04] &lt;AaronSw> But we want it adopted for good, but not for evil. ;)<br />
[5:04] &lt;look> that's what I'm doing for Eikon. My image signature generator code will be BSD<br />
[5:04] &lt;ubl> there is MGPL<br />
[5:04] &lt;tav`> mgpl?<br />
[5:04] &lt;ubl> like libgcc<br />
[5:04] &lt;ubl> GPL + exception<br />
[5:04] &lt;tav`> ah<br />
[5:04] &lt;look> what's the excpetion?<br />
[5:05] &lt;ubl> makes it suitable for embedded, for example, if you can't dynamic link,<br />
[5:05] &lt;ubl> as required for LGPL not to taint your app code.<br />
[5:05] &lt;ubl> call it LGPL + static link freedom.<br />
[5:06] * look opens package from parents, hopes it isn't contaminated with antrax<br />
[5:06] &lt;tav`> we can discuss licensing down the line<br />
[5:06] &lt;ubl> there's a metal band named anthrax.  <br />
[5:06] &lt;AaronSw> AGREED: We need a mailing list.<br />
[5:06] &lt;AaronSw> What should we call it?<br />
[5:06] &lt;ubl> i should get some cd's and mail them just so i can say i sent anthrax in the mail.<br />
[5:06] &lt;AaronSw> talk@plexdev.org?<br />
[5:06] &lt;look> ubl: gee really? I hadn't heard<br />
[5:06] &lt;look> ubl: hehheheh...and with a nick like yours<br />
[5:07] &lt;AaronSw> Do I have a second for that name? talk@plexdev.org<br />
[5:07] &lt;ubl> 2d<br />
[5:07] &lt;tav`> chat <br />
[5:07] &lt;look> Mailing lists names are irrelevant to me<br />
[5:07] &lt;tav`> ;p<br />
[5:07] &lt;AaronSw> chat has had a bad history<br />
[5:07] &lt;AaronSw> as a mailing list name<br />
[5:07] &lt;deltab> it'll be called plex- something internally<br />
[5:08] &lt;AaronSw> plex-talk sounds good to me.<br />
[5:08] &lt;tav`> plex-talk<br />
[5:08] &lt;tav`> yea<br />
[5:08] &lt;philh> name's irrelevant<br />
[5:08] &lt;AaronSw> ACTION deltab: Set up talk@plexdev.org<br />
[5:08] &lt;ubl> plex-talk fits my procmail regexps nicely<br />
[5:08] &lt;AaronSw> ... aka plex-talk<br />
[5:08] &lt;deltab> or plexdev-talk, or something<br />
[5:08] &lt;sbp> I second talk@plexdev.org<br />
[5:08] &lt;tav`> plex-talk@espnow.com > talk@plexdev.org<br />
[5:08] &lt;deltab> not just "talk", I mean<br />
[5:09] &lt;look> I want to make a text learning spam filter proxy for windows so people can share their email address freely again<br />
[5:09] &lt;AaronSw> what do you mean deltab? we can't have talk@plexdev.org? it has to have a prefix?<br />
[5:09] &lt;deltab> for internal use, yes<br />
[5:09] &lt;AaronSw> right.<br />
[5:09] &lt;AaronSw> just for internal use, tho<br />
[5:09] &lt;tav`> AaronSw: as always, aliases to the rescue ;p<br />
[5:09] &lt;deltab> mailman has system-wide list names<br />
[5:09] &lt;AaronSw> that's what I thought.<br />
[5:09] &lt;AaronSw> Next order of business...<br />
[5:10] &lt;deltab> but yes, forwarding can be set up<br />
[5:10] &lt;tav`> now, question is... do we just keep to us lot, and perhaps a few other interesting folk that join us<br />
[5:10] &lt;tav`> or do we go out and say *hello world! look at us! look at us!*<br />
[5:10] &lt;look> I vote for finishing something first<br />
[5:10] &lt;deltab> yes<br />
[5:10] &lt;philh> seconded<br />
[5:10] &lt;ubl> keep an eye out for likely high-value contributors at all times<br />
[5:10] &lt;look> avoid freenet syndrome should be our motto<br />
[5:10] &lt;AaronSw> I vote for keeping it to this group, but allowing other interesting people to join<br />
[5:10] &lt;look> yes, of course<br />
[5:10] &lt;ubl> but don't advertise until there's a dummy product<br />
[5:11] &lt;philh> yep<br />
[5:11] &lt;tav`> *nod*<br />
[5:11] &lt;look> "me too"<br />
[5:11] &lt;AaronSw> AGREED: Keep plexdevers to small group but allow others to join<br />
[5:11] &lt;tav`> and, in agreeing to become plexdevers, you are now all espians<br />
[5:11] &lt;tav`> bwahahahahahahaha!<br />
[5:11] &lt;AaronSw> heheh<br />
[5:11] &lt;AaronSw> So how about a website?<br />
[5:11] &lt;look> uh oh...it's sort of how XSL forces you to use XHTML.<br />
[5:12] &lt;tav`> let's get cris and maur onto it<br />
[5:12] &lt;look> Very trick, W3C! I admire your xml-fu.<br />

[5:12] &lt;tav`> now, i need all of your email addresses<br />
[5:12] &lt;AaronSw> Should we set up a wiki for now?<br />

[5:15] &lt;tav`> plex-talk<br />
[5:15] &lt;tav`> hmz<br />
[5:15] &lt;look> Anyone aware of a Wiki that exports XML?<br />
[5:15] &lt;tav`> the project is called plex...<br />
[5:15] &lt;AaronSw> Hmm... plex-talk, actually<br />
[5:15] &lt;AaronSw> when we move into heavy dev mode we can set up a dev list.<br />
[5:15] &lt;tav`> look: yea, mine ;p<br />
[5:16] &lt;deltab> okay<br />
[5:16] &lt;AaronSw> look, Manila sorta does... but it's not really a wiki, i suppose.<br />
[5:16] &lt;look> tav`: heh, cool.<br />
[5:16] &lt;look> Yeah, Manila isn't exactly free either.<br />
[5:16] &lt;tav`> hmz<br />

[5:18] &lt;AaronSw> Yay. :)<br />
[5:18] &lt;look> Heh<br />
[5:18] &lt;philh> hehe<br />
[5:19] &lt;tav`> but... be warned, the whole system will change<br />
[5:19] &lt;AaronSw> ...someday ;)<br />
[5:19] &lt;look> I'm having fun writing down all my various pipe-dream projects. It rules! There are so many...I'll be able to keep myself busy for years.<br />

[5:20] &lt;philh> aye<br />
[5:20] &lt;look> I've not used a zwiki<br />
[5:20] &lt;AaronSw> it's not hard to learn<br />
[5:20] &lt;AaronSw> zwiki.org<br />
[5:20] &lt;look> how different is it than a normal wiki?<br />
[5:21] &lt;deltab> added z<br />
[5:21] &lt;tav`> hehe<br />
[5:21] &lt;look> heh<br />[5:21] &lt;deltab> the z is for zope<br />
[5:21] &lt;tav`> you can link to [new pages like this] instead of using UglyCaps<br />
[5:21] &lt;AaronSw> heheh<br />
[5:21] &lt;deltab> but don't let that put you off<br />
[5:22] &lt;look> That's like usemod wiki<br />

[5:23] &lt;look> My biggest beef on WikiNames is one word identifiers...the looks sooo bad. ZoPe?<br />
[5:23] &lt;AaronSw> Yeah, that's why [big square thing] is nice.<br />
[5:23] &lt;look> yah<br />
[5:24] &lt;tav`> actually, screw zwiki, you can use the half finished old xnet as a wiki<br />
[5:24] &lt;AaronSw> Noooo.<br />
[5:24] &lt;tav`> (it works just as well)<br />
[5:24] &lt;AaronSw> We'll see...<br />

[5:24] &lt;ubl> nupedia<br />
[5:24] &lt;look> w00t<br />
[5:25] &lt;ubl> i'm throwing nupedia out on the table as a reasonable alternative <br />
[5:25] &lt;AaronSw> What do you mean?<br />
[5:25] &lt;AaronSw> alternative to what?<br />
[5:25] &lt;look> isn't nupedia a little structured for our task?<br />
[5:25] &lt;ubl> alternative to wiki<br />
[5:25] &lt;AaronSw> Hasn't nupedia switched mostly to wikipedia these days?<br />
[5:25] &lt;look> I love nupedia, by the way<br />

[5:27] &lt;AaronSw> Isn't that the new xnet?<br />
[5:28] &lt;tav`> no, that's the rewrite which i started, and then abandoned<br />
[5:29] &lt;AaronSw> So why do I need an account on there?<br />
[5:29] &lt;tav`> a) you already have an account there b) that's the temporary xnet<br />
[5:29] &lt;AaronSw> :-)<br />

[5:30] &lt;tav`> as i said, the background may change at any time, but the data shalt stay intact<br />
[5:30] &lt;tav`> so, all should be cool<br />
[5:30] &lt;AaronSw> why can't it  remember my cookies?<br />
[5:31] &lt;tav`> different domains...<br />
[5:31] &lt;tav`> 1 server, multiple domains<br />
[5:31] &lt;AaronSw> No, but it seems the cookie xnet.espnow.com gives only lasts one browser session.<br />

[5:39] &lt;aminorex> cineplex, devoplex, userplex, docuplex...  fertile ground<br />

[5:39] &lt;tav`> if you use a GUI browser, just double click on the page to edit<br />
[5:39] &lt;AaronSw> Huh?<br />
[5:40] &lt;AaronSw> You mean a Windows browser?<br />
[5:41] &lt;look> It works in Galeon. That's really weird. How does that work?<br />
[5:41] &lt;AaronSw> Javascript<br />
[5:41] &lt;look> JavaScript is the devils work. I try to avoid it where I can ;-)<br />
[5:43] &lt;AaronSw> tav, how do I create a new page?<br />
[5:43] &lt;AaronSw> Hmmph, User aaronsw is not allowed to access /espnow/x_content/plex/overview/manage_changeProperties<br />
[5:43] &lt;tav`> [new page]<br />
[5:44] &lt;look> So, this is better than a Wiki? ;-))<br />
[5:44] &lt;AaronSw> Can we get something better than <a href="http://xnet.espnow.com/plex/">http://xnet.espnow.com/plex/</a> for our homepage?<br />
[5:45] &lt;AaronSw> Like overview would be good.<br />
[5:45] &lt;tav`> plexdev.org will resolve to that<br />
[5:45] &lt;AaronSw> ok<br />
[5:46] &lt;AaronSw> deltab, can we get archives for this list?<br />
[5:47] &lt;tav`> btw, you can use whatever case you want... [NeW PagE] [NEW PAGE] [new page]<br />
[5:47] &lt;tav`> it'd create / link to the same page...<br />
[5:48] &lt;look> hurrah for case insensitivity<br />
[5:48] &lt;look> we should build that into our system as policy<br />
[5:48] &lt;AaronSw> heheh<br />
[5:48] &lt;AaronSw> ACTION deltab: create archives for mailing list<br />
[5:49] &lt;aminorex> and accent insensitivity?<br />
[5:49] * look is so pissed that XML is case sensitive :b<br />
[5:49] &lt;aminorex> cedilla insensitivity<br />
[5:49] &lt;aminorex> garcon<br />
[5:49] &lt;AaronSw> deltab, let us know when that mailing list is set up.<br />
[5:50] &lt;look> stop using words I don't understand, aminorex! Thank god for gdict.<br />
[5:50] &lt;AaronSw> OK, next thing is CVS.<br />
[5:50] &lt;AaronSw> So I can upload my Python code. :)<br />
[5:50] &lt;aminorex> what does it do?<br />
[5:50] &lt;look> do you have code for this already?<br />
[5:51] &lt;AaronSw> Yeah... It does RDF import, storage and some basic query<br />
[5:51] &lt;AaronSw> and exprot<br />
[5:51] &lt;AaronSw> err export<br />
[5:51] &lt;AaronSw> So it's somewhat related...<br />
[5:51] &lt;AaronSw> I'm hoping to build out from there.<br />
[5:51] &lt;AaronSw> trading data, passing out the query, etc.<br />
[5:51] &lt;aminorex> i take it there has been some discussion vis-a-vis dns?<br />
[5:51] &lt;tav`> aminorex: i'm not familiar with your language background...<br />
[5:52] &lt;aminorex> tav`: don't worry, neither am i.<br />
[5:52] &lt;tav`> ;p<br />
[5:52] &lt;AaronSw> aminorex, DNS in what sense?<br />
[5:52] &lt;look> vis-a-vis is such a cool word<br />
[5:52] &lt;AaronSw> plexnames is tav's plan to kill DNS<br />
[5:52] &lt;AaronSw> I did a semi-writeup at <a href="http://logicerror.com/plexnamesPaper">http://logicerror.com/plexnamesPaper</a><br />
[5:52] &lt;aminorex> thanks<br />
[5:53] &lt;AaronSw> but while tav was describing a particularly tricky part of plexnames, he handwaved and said "oh we just drop it in the plex" ;)<br />

[5:59] &lt;AaronSw> great!<br />
[5:59] &lt;atariboy> so we have gone with what name?<br />
[5:59] &lt;atariboy> fill me in<br />
[5:59] &lt;AaronSw> plex<br />
[5:59] &lt;AaronSw> At least as a codename<br />
[5:59] &lt;AaronSw> And then we can get everyone calling it plex.<br />
[5:59] &lt;AaronSw> And we bought plexdev.org,net<br />
[5:59] &lt;look> everyone is aware that plextor is a hard drive company, right?<br />
