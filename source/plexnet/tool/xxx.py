"""
Utilities for dealing with ``XXX`` and other todo related markers like ``@/@``.

If you were expecting raunchiness, then we are sorry to dissapoint ;p

Following our `style guide`_, we support 3 different forms of todo markers:

* @/@ -- requests for comments *and* todo.
* BBB -- backwards compatibility code indicator.
* XXX -- temporary marker for todo items.
